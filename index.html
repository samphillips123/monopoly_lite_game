            <!-- Need to add actual text for the "how to" -->
            <p>The goal of the game is to invest in as many properties as possible without going bankrupt! Click the die to initiate each turn, alternating between players. If a property is available to purchase, choose "Yes" or "No" to add to your investment portfolio, or move on. Buy properties so that you can charge rent when your opponent visits. Each time you pass "Go" you will earn an allowance. Also, make sure you don't get sent to jail or else you will skip a turn!<br><br><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
