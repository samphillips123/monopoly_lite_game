            <p>The goal of the game is to invest in as many properties as possible without going bankrupt! <br><strong>Click the die to initiate each turn</strong>, alternating between players. <br>If a property is available to purchase, choose "Yes" or "No" to add to your investment portfolio, or move on. <br>Buy properties so that you can charge rent when your opponent visits. <br>Each time you pass "Go" you will earn an allowance. <br>Also, make sure you don't get sent to jail or else you will skip a turn!<br><br><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
